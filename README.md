# A-Baseline-Framework-for-Part-level-Action-Parsing-and-Action-Recognition
2nd place solution for Kinetics-TPS Track in ICCV DeeperAction Workshop 2021
This technical report introduces our 2nd place solution to
Kinetics-TPS Track on Part-level Action Parsing in ICCV DeeperAction Workshop 2021. 
Our entry is
mainly based on YOLOF for instance and part detection, HRNet for human pose estimation, and CSN for video-level action recognition and frame-level part state parsing. 
We describe technical details for the Kinetics-TPS dataset, together with some experimental results. 
In the competition, we achieved 61.37\% mAP on the test set of Kinetics-TPS.
